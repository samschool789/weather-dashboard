# WEATHER DASHBOARD

# My job was to make a dashboard that would display a 5 day forecast when you select a city

# It will display the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temp,
# humidity, the wind speed and UV index

# Have the city you initally select save to use at a later time

# Show the Future weather conditions for the city
